To facilitate the seamless deployment of the project on a local machine, adhere to the following procedural steps:

Step 1: Clone the Repository:<br>
  Begin by cloning the project repository using the command: "git clone [repository_url]"<br>
  This establishes a local copy of the project on your machine.

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment:<br>
  Instigate a virtual environment within the project directory to encapsulate dependencies. Execute the following command: "python -m venv venv"<br>
  This ensures an isolated environment for the project.

Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment:<br>
  Activate the virtual environment to create a confined workspace. Depending on your operating system, utilize the appropriate activation command:<br>
    For Windows: "venv\Scripts\activate"<br>
    For Unix/macOS: "source venv/bin/activate"
    
Step 4: Install Project Dependencies:<br>
  Install the requisite dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file to ensure all essential packages are in place. Execute the following command: "pip install -r requirements.txt"<br>
  This ensures a consistent environment across different instances.

Step 5: Run the Application:<br>
Initiate the project by running the app.py file. Execute the following command: "python app.py"
